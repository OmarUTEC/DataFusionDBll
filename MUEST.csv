Pangarap,Barbie's Cradle,"Minsan pa Nang ako'y napalingon Hindi ko alam Na ika'y tutugon Sa mga tanong na aking nabitawan Hindi ko alam kung ito'y totoo Pangarap ka Sa bawat sandali Langit man ang tingin ko Sayo sana'y marating Hanggang dito na lang yata Ang kaya kong gawin Mangarap na lang At bumulong sa hangin Kailan kaya Darating ulit ang isang Sandali Na ako'y lilingon muli Pangarap ka o tinig mong kay lamig Ang iyong mga ngiti na sa akin ay Nakapagbigay pansin (Ikaw ba ay isang pangarap lang) Pangarap ka o tinig mong kay lamig Ang iyong mga ngiti Na sa akin ay Nakapagbigay... Pangarap ka o tinig mong kay lamig Ang iyong mga ngiti Na sa akin ay Nakapagbigay Pangarap ka o tinig mong kay lamig Ang iyong mga ngiti Na sa akin ay Nakapagbigay pansin"
I Feel Alive,Steady Rollin,"The trees, are singing in the wind The sky blue, only as it can be And the angels, smiled at me I saw you, in that lonely bench At half past four, I kissed your soft soft hands and at 6 I kissed your lips and the angels smiled, I thought Hey I feel alive! The park sign, said it was closed And we jumped that fence with no cares at all and we kissed under a tree We danced, under the midnight sun And I loved you, without knowing you at all and we laughed and felt so free and the angels they smiled, I thought Hey, I feel alive!"
Poison,Bell Biv DeVoe,"Yeah, Spyderman and Freeze in full effect Uh-huh You ready, Ron? I'm ready You ready, Biv? I'm ready, Slick, are you? Oh, yeah, break it down Girl, I, must (warn you) I sense something strange in my mind Situation is (serious) Let's cure it cause we're running out of time It's oh, so (beautiful) Relationships they seem from the start It's all so (deadly) When love is not together from the heart It's drivin' me out of my mind!

Baby It's Cold Outside (feat. Christina Aguilera),CeeLo Green,"I really can't stay Baby it's cold outside I've got to go away Baby it's cold out there This evening has been Been hoping that you'd drop in So very nice I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice My mother will start to worry Beautiful, what's your hurry? My father will be pacing the floor Listen to that fireplace roar So really I'd better scurry Beautiful, please don't hurry Well maybe just a half a drink more Why don't you put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think Baby, it's bad out there Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there"

Pangarap,James TW,"Hold your breath, don't look down, keep trying Darling, it's okay to be scared, it's frightening At times it just feels like the world is trying hard to knock us down But there's a reason that we're still here but no one else is around How we've grown Every single day I'm proud I swear, I won't Let anything stop us now I'm not a soldier But I'll fight through our darkest of days Get on my shoulders And I'll carry you all of the way"
