The park sign, said it was closed And we jumped that fence with no cares at all and we kissed under a tree We danced, under the midnight sun And I loved you, without knowing you at all and we laughed and felt so free and the angels they smiled, I thought Hey, I feel alive!",

    "lyrics": "All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me Somebody I can love for them All this money don't mean shit If you ain't got nobody to share it with Love rules the world, you feel me He don't understand you like I do No he'll never make love to you like I do So give it to me Cause I can show you 'bout a real love And I can promise anything that I do Is just to satisfy you When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but We one in the same girl, it ain't a game So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you In good and bad times, we'll always make it through Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you I could straight lace you, not just appearance Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void When you spend time with your woman and listen It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt And prove to you you're more important than anything else Worthwhile, special like my first child When I see your face it's always like the first time Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to Let it be known, I told you And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby) Waiting for love like this too long (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby) All that you need I can give you (You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on) I do, satisfy you (You don't have to wait on him) I'm the light when you can't see I'm that air when you can't breathe I'm that feeling when you can't leave Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive So it's only you and me When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong Keep you away from harm, my love is protected I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil Make love all night, bending bed coils You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal This is all for you, cause I simply adore you until fade This one right here goes out to all my sisters",
